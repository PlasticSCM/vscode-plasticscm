### Checkin

You can type in the input field in the SCM view and hit `Ctrl+Enter` to checkin
**all your pending changes**. We don't support selecting what items you want to

You can also invoke the Checkin command using the Command Palette. You'll be
prompted to enter a commit message in that case.
